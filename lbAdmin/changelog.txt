1) Database password encryption added.

	Following are the steps to be followed by the admin for the database password encryption. 

	* Run PasswordEncryptor.sh or PasswordEncryptor.bat (pass password text as a parameter) from lbAdmin to generate the encrypted password.
		- Ex: PasswordEncryption -p <db_password>
		- Generated encrypted password will be stored in a file @ admin/password.txt

	* Copy the encrypted password from password.txt and paste it in lbConfig.props file ( DB_PASSWORD=<Encrypted_Password> )

	* Set the new lbConfig parameter DB_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTED=true (value case insensitive) .
		- Note : any value other than 'true' (or no value) for DB_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTED is considered as 'false'.

	* When password encryption is off, use the password directly with out encryption.
