20000001$Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (SMQ)$1$Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a form of rapid ventricular tachycardia which can be hereditary or acquired. In some acquired forms, there appear to be genetic predispositions related to sub-clinical potassium channel abnormalities. On electrocardiogram (ECG),TdP is associated with or preceded by polymorphic QRS complexes; other ECG changes include prolonged QT or QTc interval, prominent U waves, T wave alternans or bizarre T wave aberrations, and long-short sequences. TdP can resolve spontaneously, but acquired forms often recur until the underlying cause is corrected, and can progress to ventricular fibrillation. Clinical manifestations include palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and, rarely, sudden death.$Zipes DP. Specific arrhythmias: diagnosis and treatment.

20000002$Rhabdomyolysis/myopathy (SMQ)$1$Myopathy is a disorder of striated muscle, with or without changes in muscle mass, and may be accompanied by muscle pain or tenderness. Rhabdomyolysis results from extensive necrosis of skeletal muscle with release of muscle contents and can be related to hereditary metabolic or structural abnormalities effecting skeletal muscle cells or non-hereditary causes such as (e.g., trauma). Muscle signs and symptoms include pain, weakness, tenderness, and contractures, weight gain, fatigue, malaise, fever, nausea, tachycardia, and dark urine.

20000042$Interstitial lung disease (SMQ)$1$Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions that involve the alveolar walls and perialveolar tissue. The ILDs are nonmalignant and are not caused by any defined infectious agents. Approximately 180 known individual diseases are characterized by interstitial lung involvement, either as primary disease or as a significant part of a multiorgan process, as occurs in collagen vascular diseases. The initial response is inflammation in the air spaces and alveolar walls. If the disease is chronic, inflammation spreads to adjacent portions of the interstitium and vasculature and eventually produces interstitial fibrosis. Scarring and distortion of lung tissue leads to significant derangement of gas exchange and ventilatory function. One approach to classification is to separate ILDs into two groups based on 1) known causes or 2) unknown causes. Each group can be further subdivided based on the presence or absence of granulomas.$Not provided$$16$A$N$$1354

20000116$Acute central respiratory depression (SMQ)$1$Acute central respiratory depression is a form of respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is defined as impairment of gas exchange between ambient air and circulating blood: problems in intrapulmonary gas exchange lead to hypoxemia and problems in the movement of gases cause hypercapnia. Depression of the respiratory center with resulting respiratory acidosis may occur: acutely with general anesthetics, sedatives, and head trauma, or chronically with sedatives, alcohol, intracranial tumors, and syndromes of sleep-disordered breathing, including the primary alveolar and obesity-hypoventilation syndromes. Acute hypoxemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and coma. Alteration of consciousness is typical, confusion is common. Acute hypercapnia may cause: subtle personality changes and headache through to marked confusion and narcosis, cerebral vasodilation and increased CSF pressure, acidemia which, when severe, contributes to pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction, systemic vascular dilation, reduced myocardial contractility, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and cardiac irritability. Central respiratory depression mainly occurs in neonates of prematurity or in sleep apnea. Apnea of prematurity may be caused by CNS immaturity (central) or airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea (CSA) has two categories: 1. Hypercapnia with decreased ventilatory drive or a decreased ability to breathe. 2. Eucapnia or hypocapnia with increased ventilatory drive but sleep-induced apnea and periodic breathing. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a discrete pattern of this form of CSA that may be seen in opiate associated respiratory depression.$The Merck Manual accessed online on 12 January 2006: http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec06/ch065/ch065c.html?qt=acute%20respiratory&alt=sh .

20000135$Accidents and injuries (SMQ)$1$Accidents and injuries have been associated with use of medications, particularly older psychotropic medications, and especially patients with pre-existing high risk levels and/or continuing mental problems. In a study of falls in elderly, use of certain drugs (benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and antidepressants) was an independent risk factor. Study on risk of accidental injury and benzodiazepines also confirmed an increased risk, especially in patients who had recently filled their prescription. "Accident" is defined as "an unplanned or unintended but sometimes predictable event leading to injury, e.g., in traffic, industry, or a domestic setting, or such an event developing in the course of a disease." In medicine, the term "injury" can have a very broad meaning. For the purpose of this SMQ, a more narrow definition is used, i.e., "to injure" is "to wound, hurt or harm". Focus of this SMQ is not on "metabolic" injury (toxicity, etc.), but on personal injury or accident to the individual as a result of altered perception, consciousness, attention, behavior, etc.$Wadsworth, EJK, Moss, SC, Simpson, SA, and Smith, AP. Psychotropic medication use and accidents, injuries and cognitive failures. Hum Psychopharmacol Clin Exp 2005; 20: 391-400; Tinetti, ME, Speechley, M, and Ginter, SF.

Benzodiazepine tranquilizers and the risk of accidental injury. Am J Public Health 1990; 80: 1467-1470; Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 27th edition, 2000$Currently, many MedDRA PTs (e.g., PT Gallbladder injury) have dual links to groupings in SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications and groupings in "disorder" SOCs, implying that the terms can represent either metabolic or traumatic injury. This needs to be borne in mind when reviewing cases retrieved by this SMQ. Users should consider including cases coded to LLT Loss of teeth due to accident, extraction, or local periodontal disease - this term is not currently linked to an included PT in this SMQ but may retrieve cases of interest.$16$A$N$$3490
20000136$Extravasation events (injections, infusions and implants) (SMQ)$1$Extravasation of drug product administered by venous access is a local complication can be associated with pain and swelling. Can be associated with pain and swelling. Some products may be associated with more serious sequelae including tissues necrosis. May be caused by: damage to the posterior wall of the vein or occlusion of the vein proximal to the injection site; occlusion of vein proximal to injection site. Extravasation is broadly defined as discharge or escape of blood or other fluid normally found in a vessel or tube, into the surrounding tissues. For purposes of this SMQ, "extravasation" relates to complication of drug delivery (injection, effusion, etc.) or to a device (includes potential sequelae of extravasation). Pain, erythema, and swelling are typically observed. Included: Terms with "extravasation" that are related to drug delivery or devices; terms with "injection", "infusion", "implant", "catheter" and "device" when combined with "induration", "edema", "effusion", "swelling", "irritation", "necrosis", and "ulcer". For future maintenance of this SMQ, PT terms with "instillation" could be considered for inclusion if they fit definition of SMQ; terms for administration site pain and erythema. Excluded: PT Extravasation blood and PT Extravasation of urine; PT Contrast media reaction; PT Inappropriate device irritation of tissue; PT Wrong technique in drug usage process; PT Systemic leakage ; "application site" terms; PT Injection site reaction and other plain "site reaction" PTs (e.g., PT Infusion site reaction) as these are non-specific.$Brown, S.

Long-Term Central Venous Catheters: Issues for Care. Semin Oncol Nurs 1992;8,2(May):133-147$Administration site pain and erythema are symptoms of extravasation (and are currently included in this SMQ) but can occur without it. These terms could retrieve more cases of interest than is practical in certain databases, depending on coding practices. This should be borne in mind when applying this SMQ. In general, "application site" terms are considered not appropriate for the scope of this SMQ, even though they did retrieve a few cases of interest during pre-production testing. MedDRA users should consider - based on their own data - if "application site" terms may have been used when coding cases related to extravasation and include relevant terms as needed$16$A$N$$3537
20000140$Gastrointestinal nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedures (SMQ)$2$Constructed around symptoms frequently attributed to drugs, (e.g., nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diarrhea and constipation). Applies to gastrointestinal tract from esophagus to rectum. For this SMQ, "nonspecific" means conditions are possible manifestations of multiple diseases. Included: Any non-specific functional condition of the whole gastrointestinal tract; non-specific inflammatory manifestations of the whole gastrointestinal tract; non-specific dysfunctional manifestations of the whole gastrointestinal tract; disorders relative to mucosal erosions; terms from SOC Investigations; terms from SOC Surgical and medical procedures. Excluded: Any dysfunction or inflammation in oropharyngeal cavity; inflammatory or dysfunctional conditions which are independent, well defined nosologic entities (e.g., PT Crohn's disease and PT Colitis ulcerative); infective gastroenteritis. SMQ Gastrointestinal nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedures is for terms frequently associated with terms in SMQ Gastrointestinal nonspecific dysfunction and-or SMQ Gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammation indistinctly. Includes terms for therapeutic procedures$Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Edition; Medline database; The Merck Manual; Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary$NOTE: To search for cases of more specific pathology, the following SMQs could be considered: SMQ Acute pancreatitis; SMQ Gastrointestinal perforation, ulceration, haemorrhage or obstruction; and SMQ Pseudomembranous colitis)$16$A$N$$3550
20000144$Ischaemic colitis (SMQ)$1$Ischaemic colitis is injury of large intestine that results from interruption of its blood supply. Caused by transient reduction in blood flow to colon. Most patients are elderly, but also occurs in younger ages associated with oral contraceptive use, vasculitis, hypercoagulable states. Clinical picture depends on degree and rate of development of ischemia. Acute fulminant ischaemic colitis: severe lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and hypotension; dilatation of colon (severe cases); signs of peritonitis (severe cases). Subacute ischaemic colitis: most common clinical variant; produces lesser degrees of pain and bleeding (occurring over several days or weeks). Ischemic colitis is second most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis made by colonoscopy. Usually develops in absence of major vessel occlusion. Associated factors: decreased cardiac output; arrhythmia; trauma; surgery (e.g., aorto-iliac surgery); vasculitis; coagulation disorders; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; irritable bowel syndrome; specific drugs. More than two thirds of patients respond to conservative measures (IV fluids, bowel rest, antibiotics). Surgery rarely required$Satyaprasad V Alapati SV, Mihas AA. When to suspect ischemic colitis.

20000145$Haemodynamic oedema, effusions and fluid overload (SMQ)$1$Drug-induced edema has been described for a number of medications. Mechanisms: Enhanced sodium and water reabsorption by kidneys; potent vasodilators and calcium channel blockers (cause capillary leakage); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis. Other drug products associated with peripheral edema: Antidepressants, estrogens, corticosteroids, COX-2 inhibitors. Edema definition: presence of abnormally large amounts of fluid in intercellular tissue spaces. Usually refers to demonstrable amounts of fluid in subcutaneous tissues. May be localized (due to venous or lymphatic obstruction or increased vascular permeability) or systemic (due to heart failure or renal disease). Sometimes designated by other terms according to site (ascites, hydrothorax, or hydropericardium). Massive generalized edema is called anasarca. Synonyms: dropsy and hydrops. Effusion definition: escape of fluid from lymphatics or blood vessels into a cavity or tissues; results from altered hydrostatic forces$Schroth, BE. Evaluation and management of peripheral edema.

20000147$Hypertension (SMQ)$1$Hypertension is defined as high arterial blood pressure. Causes are either unknown (essential or idiopathic hypertension) or associated with other primary diseases (secondary hypertension). Various criteria for its threshold range from 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic to 200 mm Hg systolic and 110 mm Hg diastolic. Per 2003 ESH/ESC Hypertension Guidelines and NHLBI, optimal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Prehypertension is defined as blood pressure120-139/80-89 mm Hg. Newer definitions characterize hypertension as a complex progressive cardiovascular syndrome. The majority of patients are asymptomatic; hypertension is only identified by measuring blood pressure. Signs and symptoms include headache (only in severe hypertension); and other possibly related complaints: dizziness, flushed face, early fatigability, palpitation, and nervousness. Complaints referable to vascular effects include epistaxis, hematuria and blurring of vision. Common presentations of hypertensive emergencies are chest pain, dyspnoea, and neurologic deficit. Neurologic presentations include occipital headache, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, visual disturbance, or hypertensive encephalopathy. No early pathological changes occur in primary hypertension. Ultimately, generalized arteriolar sclerosis develops, particularly in the kidneys. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential.$Journal of Hypertension 2003, Vol 21 No 10; Journal of Hypertension 1999, Vol 17 No 2; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Ed (2005). Part 8, Sect. 4; Dorland's Medical Dictionary, 30th Edition, 2003$Users of this SMQ are reminded to consider the possibility of searching for etiology, signs and symptoms and consequence terms excluded from this SMQ (see Table 2 in original CIOMS WG documentation) if hypertension may be a de novo signal. Users may also consider using other SMQs, such as Ischaemic heart disease (SMQ) and Central nervous system haemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents (SMQ) to identify consequences of hypertension.$16$A$N$$3770
20000150$Cardiomyopathy (SMQ)$1$Cardiomyopathy: general diagnostic term designating primary non-inflammatory disease of heart muscle. Often of obscure or unknown etiology. Not the result of: ischemia, hypertension, congenital anomaly, valvular disease, or pericardial disease. Usually subdivided into the following forms: dilated; hypertrophic; and restrictive. According to World Health Organization (WHO): only those disorders in which pathological process involves only myocardium; cause is unknown; not part of a disease affecting other organs; also called "primary cardiomyopathy"$Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, Saunders, Philadelphia, 2000; Towbin JA, Lipshultz SE.: Genetics of neonatal cardiomyopathy. Curr Opin Cardiol. 1999 May;14(3):250-62.$The narrow search is very specific, and cardiomyopathy - seen from the reporting and adverse event coding perspective - does not have very specific signs or symptoms. PT Dyspnoea might create substantial "noise" in retrieval of cases and therefore may be excluded from a query. In testing, most cases were retrieved by broad search terms (and were not also retrieved by narrow search terms).$16$A$N$$3790
20000154$Demyelination (SMQ)$1$Demyelination: loss of myelin with preservation of the axons or fiber tracts. Group of diseases of nervous system with damage and destruction of myelin sheaths surrounding nerve fibers. Axons may be damaged as well. Mechanism of myelin damage may be different in various diseases. Impairs conduction of signals in affected nerves. Causes impairment in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions. Most common demyelinating disease is multiple sclerosis. Other examples include central pontine myelinolysis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord. Central demyelination occurs within central nervous system (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Peripheral demyelination affects peripheral nervous system (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome). Other causes: genetic, autoimmune reaction, immunological disorders, nutritional or metabolic disorder, toxins (including some used in therapy such as anti-mitotic agents and radiotherapy), unknown.$http://www.uvm.edu/~jkessler/NP/neumyshe.htm#anchor4438902; Gale Encyclopedia of Neurological Disorders. 2005.

Timperley, M.D. Lecture. 2000. http://www.dokkyomed.ac.jp/dep-k/cli-path/a-super/super-demyeli.html$If searching for a de novo signal of demyelination, it is recommended to use the narrow and broad terms in this SMQ and also SMQ Peripheral neuropathy and SMQ Guillain-Barre syndrome. Broad terms for signs and symptoms of demyelinating diseases were excluded because they are in SMQ Peripheral neuropathy and SMQ Guillain-Barre syndrome. Some broad terms were also excluded as being too non-specific, related to advanced demyelination, or because of poor performance in SMQ testing. These excluded terms (see Tables 1 and 2 in the original CIOMS WG documentation) may be included in a search at the user's discretion.$16$A$N$$4214
20000157$Eosinophilic pneumonia (SMQ)$1$Eosinophilic pneumonias are characterized by accumulation of eosinophils in alveolar spaces, interstitium, or both. Peripheral eosinophilia is common. Causes include: infections (especially helminthic); drug-induced pneumonitis (e.g., antibiotics, phenytoin, l-tryptophan); inhaled toxins (e.g., cocaine); systemic disease (e.g., Churg Strauss syndrome); allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Diagnosis based on opacities on chest X-ray and eosinophilia in peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia has unknown etiology. Suspected to be allergic diathesis. Fulminant illness with cough, fever, weight loss, accompanied by or preceded by asthma in 50% of cases. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia also has unknown etiology but may be acute hypersensitivity reaction to unidentified inhaled antigen. Characterized by acute febrile illness with cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgias, night sweats, and pleuritic chest pain. Loeffler's syndrome may be caused by parasitic infections, especially Ascaris lumbricoides, but identifiable agent often not found. Characterized by absent or mild respiratory symptoms, fleeting migratory pulmonary opacities, and peripheral blood eosinophilia.$1.

20000174$Vasculitis (SMQ)$1$Vasculitis: inflammation of blood vessel walls. Clinical and pathological features vary depending on site and type of blood vessels affected. Primary vasculitis: vasculitis is the primary process. Examples are: temporal arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Wegener's granulomatosis. Vasculitis can be a secondary feature as with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of and damage to blood vessels. Vessel lumen is usually compromised. Vasculitis is associated with ischemia of tissues supplied by the involved vessel. A broad and heterogeneous group of syndromes may result from this process. Any type, size, and location of blood vessel may be involved and may be confined to a single organ, such as skin, or may simultaneously involve several organ systems.$Savage COS et al.

20000175$Conjunctival disorders (SMQ)$1$Conjunctiva is mucous membrane investing anterior surface of eye (bulbar conjunctiva) and posterior surface of eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva).  Disorders that affect conjunctiva include: acute conjunctivitis (viral, bacterial, inclusion, seasonal/allergic); chronic conjunctivitis (trachoma, perennial allergic, vernal keratoconjunctivitis); trauma (subconjunctival hemorrhage, foreign bodies, lacerations); degenerative conditions (Cogan's senile plaque, pinguecula, pterygium, concretions, retention cysts); blistering mucocutaneous diseases (cicatrical pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome); pigmented lesions; and tumors.  [Note that the exclusion criteria for this SMQ excludes terms for known causes of or syndromes associated with conjunctival disorders (e.g., PT Pemphigoid).  Symptoms vary according to underlying problem.  Some common features are: complaints of a red eye; epiphora (excess tears); irritation, such as a foreign body sensation, due to presence of follicles or papillae; itching - hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis but may also occur in blepharitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca; pain - generally mild (in absence of trauma, significant pain is unusual); and complaints of a discharge.$Scott, O.

20000178$Osteoporosis/osteopenia (SMQ)$1$Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by: decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture. Osteopenia is a milder form of bone loss.  Increased fracture risk even with minimal trauma; most common sites for bone loss and resultant fractures are thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, ribs, upper femur, lower radius. Usually causes no signs or symptoms except height loss and kyphosis until fractures occur. Pathogenesis: genetics; medications; diet; race; gender; lifestyle; physical activity. Type 1 (postmenopausal) is most common; results from sex hormone deficiency; increased recruitment/responsiveness of osteoclast precursors and increased bone resorption outpace bone formation; decreased trabecular bone leads to an increased risk of Colles and vertebral fractures; estrogen deficiency may cause bone to be more sensitive to parathyroid hormone, leading to increased calcium release from bone, decreased renal calcium excretion, and increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; gonadal deficiency may also increase production of cytokines that have an influence on osteoclasts. Type 2 (senile) occurs in both genders; decreased formation of bone and decreased renal production of 1,25(OH)2 D3 occurring late in life; loss of cortical and trabecular bone leads to increased fracture risk in hip, long bones, vertebrae. Type 3, secondary to medications or due to other conditions that cause increased bone loss by various mechanisms. Bone mineral density frequently used as approximate measure of bone strength. WHO defines osteoporosis as bone density 2.5 standard deviations below mean for young adult white females. Markers of bone turnover (bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, type I procollagen peptides,  and urinary deoxypyridinoline) sometimes used to monitor response to therapy$Hobar, C.

20000181$Renovascular disorders (SMQ)$1$Renovascular disorders include: atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (most common primary disease of the renal arteries); fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries; embolic renal artery occlusion; and renovascular microvascular disorders. All can result in renal dysfunction, usually evidenced by high plasma renin levels. Usually present in one of three forms: asymptomatic renal artery stenosis; renovascular hypertension; ischemic nephropathy. Primarily due to constriction of afferent renal artery resulting in decreased perfusion pressure of larger circulation and/or microcirculation. Disorder of larger circulation is commonly due to unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Microcirculation disorders are commonly due to small vessel thrombosis from proximal upstream thrombi (e.g., in the stenosed renal artery) or from distal sites (e.g., intracardiac thrombi). Mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced renal dysfunction include: damage to kidney vasculature or structures; hemolytic uremic syndrome; prerenal perfusion deficits. Renovascular disorders may result in progressive severe hypertension with the usual sequelae of this condition.$Bloch MJ, Basile J.

Lactation associated disorders (functional and related to neonatal exposures through breast milk) are also in this SMQ, but fertility-related topics and developmental disorders are not.  Referenced during construction of this SMQ was EMA's Guideline on the Exposure to Medicinal Products during Pregnancy: Need for Post-Authorisation Data in which pregnancy outcomes are defined as:  Live birth, normal; Live birth, abnormal (including pre-term, term, and post-term birth; small for gestational age infants/ Intrauterine growth retardation; drug withdrawal syndrome in the neonate; malformations; and morbidity); Fetal death (including ectopic, miscarriage and stillbirth); and Termination of pregnancy.  Sub-search SMQ Termination of pregnancy and risk of abortion relates to abortions (spontaneous, induced, stillbirth) and their associated complications, and procedures and investigations related to pregnancy termination.  Risk factors for abortions are also addressed.$Guideline on the Exposure to Medicinal Products during Pregnancy: Need for Post-Authorisation Data.

20000211$Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (SMQ)$1$Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) is characterized by:sudden onset of reduced muscle tone; hyporesponsiveness (to verbal or other stimuli)' changed skin color (pallor, cyanosis).  HHE has occurred after immunization with the following vaccines: diphtheria; tetanus; Haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis B vaccines. Most reports followed administration of pertussis component vaccines. More often associated with: whole-cell vaccines than acellular types; during primary immunization, generally following the first dose. Unclear if observed phenomena are related to: characteristics of the vaccine; immunologic phenomenon; toxic component(s) in the vaccine; combination of factors. In US vaccine surveillance system (VAERS), slightly more females (53%) than males experienced HHE, however, more reports of HHE in males have been noted in the Netherlands vaccine surveillance system. Time to onset of signs after immunization is generally three to four hours but can range from immediately to up to 48 hours post-immunization. Episode typically lasts six to thirty minutes. Up to one-third of cases also describe a fever. The Brighton Collaboration (BC) HHE Working Group - in developing a case definition for HHE - described diagnostic algorithms with three levels of certainty based on clinical observations at the time of the episode:$Buettcher, M et al.

These should not be considered as definitively excluded from the SMQ as future advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of HHE may involve laboratory studies. Based on results of all CIOMS SMQ Working Group tests, the BC Level 1 algorithm is the recommended algorithm on which to base the SMQ. Users may choose to use additional algorithms.

20000214$Hypersensitivity (SMQ)$1$Aim of this SMQ is to support database searches for potentially drug/vaccine related hypersensitivity/allergic reactions in connection with Risk Management Plans, PSUR and other surveillance activities; designed to retrieve all types of cases possibly related to hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; SMQ is not intended to differentiate between different types of hypersensitivity reactions such as the Coombs classification. A number of SMQs for specific allergic conditions already exist (e.g. SMQ Anaphylactic reaction, SMQ Angioedema).  "Hypersensitivity" is often used in a very general way to describe a large number of conditions related to an exaggerated response of the body to a foreign agent; a more restricted use is for allergic reactions of all types. Many terms included in SMQ Hypersensitivity do not permit differentiation between hypersensitivity/allergic reactions and other causes for the given event and therefore further analysis of cases retrieved by the SMQ is required.$[None provided]$In a number of instances, for events having a similar phenomenological appearance, some PTs were included as either narrow or broad scope terms and some not at all depending on the likelihood of a relationship to drug/vaccine administration.  For example, of the many rhinitis terms available in MedDRA, only PT Rhinitis allergic (narrow scope) and various seasonal/perennial rhinitis terms (broad scope) were included.  Similarly, of the various asthma terms, only PT Analgesic asthma syndrome was included as narrow and PT Asthma, PT Asthma late onset,  PT Status asthmaticus, PT Asthmatic crisis, PT Infantile asthma, PT Occupational asthma were included as broad scope terms. Terms for autoimmune disorders were excluded. If, however, these conditions are required in a search, the user is referred to HLGT Autoimmune disorders which provides a comprehensive grouping of such terms. Terms for transplant rejections (also excluded), if required, are covered by HLT Transplant rejections.  Terms for idiosyncratic reactions are excluded. If these are required (reactions representing an abnormal reaction to a drug, not caused by allergy), the user is referred to PT Idiosyncratic drug reaction.$16$A$N$$6972
20000215$Malignant lymphomas (SMQ)$1$Lymphoma: a heterogeneous group of malignancies generally divided into non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin disease.  NHL is about 85% of lymphomas.  Median age at diagnosis is sixth decade. Some forms of NHL - such as Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma - occur in younger patients. Classified by several different systems (e.g., Working Formulation, REAL classification) based on morphology and clinical behavior. Variety of laboratory and imaging studies are used to evaluate and stage NHL. Treatment depends on stage, grade, type and various patient factors (symptoms, age, etc.). NHL may result from: chromosomal translocations; infections (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] and hepatitis C virus); environmental factors (radiation exposure and chemotherapy); immunodeficiency states; and chronic inflammation. Clinical presentation depends on location of disease and biologic characteristics (e.g., low grade vs. high grade). Peripheral adenopathy and B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) are characteristic for some forms of NHL. Hodgkin lymphoma: has histologic findings, biologic behavior, and clinical characteristics distinct from NHL. Excisional lymph node biopsy generally recommended to establish diagnosis. Various imaging studies used to determine disease stage. Lymphadenopathy and constitutional B symptoms are characteristic. Treated with multiagent chemotherapy, plus or minus radiation therapy. Etiology of Hodgkin lymphoma has not been established. Certain infectious agents, e.g. EBV, may be involved. HIV infected patients have a higher incidence. Genetic predisposition may also play a role.$Vinjamaram, S. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/203399-overview; Dessain, SK. Hodgkin lymphoma. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/201886-overview$Testing in a regulatory database determined that some cases of interest were found with PT Pseudolymphoma for data entered in 2006 or earlier; for more recent cases, PT Pseudolymphoma did not retrieve relevant cases.  Inclusion of PT Pseudolymphoma in the broad scope for searches of data from 2006 and earlier might be considered.$16$A$N$$7053
