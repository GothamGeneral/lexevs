You must choose your entire LexBIG or LexBIO installation path.

For example - if you have LexBIG installed here:
C:\Program Files\LexGrid\LexBIG\1.0.0rc4

Then choose the 1.0.0rc4 folder.

This will create a 'gui' subfolder in your LexBIG / LexBIO installation.

You will get a warning about installing into a location that already exists - this is expected.
