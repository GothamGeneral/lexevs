lbGUI changelog. 
* 7/01/08
* A column was added to lbGUI indicating which database or table
* group a coding scheme resided in.  Implemented in response to Gforge
* item # 12995.
*
* 1/22/08
* Enabled viewing of Property Links in the graph.
*
* 1/14/08
* Added a MRIER option to the Metathesaurus load.
*
* 12/14/07
* Added parameter for using Protege database load to NCI OWL loader

*************************
Released with build 2.1 *
*************************
* 10/08/07
* Add option for recalculation of root nodes to NCI Meta load.

* 09/20/07
* Remove MRHIER option to build from all context entries; not required
* and yields poor performance on UMLS loads.  Also, change the default
* to '0' to enable most performant option.

* 09/07/07
* Prevent error and GUI exit on default resolution of reverse hierarchy
* from '@@', and change error message text used for GUI exit. 

* 08/30/07
* For code set display, change label of top or end node to '@' and '@@'
* instead of 'top-thing' and 'leaf-thing'.  Also remove the hasSubtype and
* isa labels from top/end node connections; can be confusing since often
* the subsumption relation for the ontology uses a different name.

* 08/22/07
* Fixed Gforge item #6971.  Logging options now generate logging specific to the 
* choice checked.  Previously, these option checks produced no new results
* unless user checked the option to log everything.

* 05/04/07
* Prevent the load dialogs from closing while a load is in progress
* Add a tree view to allow for easier navigation of concepts within a large
  ontology.

* 06/24/07
* Allow CodedNodeGraph's to be restricted based on directionalName.

* 07/18/07
* On display of coded node set, allow resolution of graph for the selected
  entry to contain items up to the number allowed by the config.props.
  Previously this had a hard coded max of 500, which had a greater tendency
  to truncate display of associations for some nodes.
* Added informational log entry instead of System.out for tree view.

*************************
Released with build 2.x *
*************************
* 04/22/07
* Allow instantiation of LB_GUI class with specific LexBIGService instance,
  per NCI requirement for remote service invocation.

* 04/14/07
* Add association qualifier(s) to edge text when available.
* Display [R] in edge label (with association name) if association directional
  name is not available and navigation direction is reversed.
* Tweaks to help improve spacing and visualization of graphs with many items:
  Bump space between items for improved readability of relation text.
  Limit maximum number of characters displayed for secondary nodes.
  Left-align multi-line text.
* Change preferred font in graph view to 'Arial Unicode MS' to assist with
  display of multilingual characters (when available).
  
* 04/18/07
* Fix handling of resolved list expansion.  As part of selection/expansion,
  a 'trail of breadcrumbs' will be maintained by listing in blue all items
  that have been visited.  In addition, items that have been automatically
  added to the graph will be italicized to help differentiate (until paged
  in normally).  If paged in as part of query results, italicized items
  will be unitalicized and relocated in the list to match any sort options
  that may have been set.
  
* 04/19/07
* Provide visibility of relations between secondary nodes in graph views.

* 04/20/07
* Allow conditional display of codes and of relations between secondary
  nodes, to allow mimic of viewer behavior in previous release and required
  to prevent graph complexity from hindering readability in some situations
  (e.g. default graph of UMLS semantic net).

****************************************
Released with lbImpl 2.x   02/15/07    *
****************************************
* Add support to display associations from all relation containers defined to a
  code system; native or non-native.

****************************************
* Added the ability to restrict on property qualifiers.
* minor corrections and cleanup of display of sources, property qualifiers.

  when code systems were unioned.
* Fixed a bug that caused the gui to crash if you clicked on whitespace below the end 
  of the resolved concept list.
* Made the graph resolve nodes from all relations containers instead of just the default
  relations container when clicking on individual concepts in a resolved coded node set.

****************************************
