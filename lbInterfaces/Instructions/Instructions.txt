Building the lbInterfaces directory:

1) Make sure that the lgModel.jar is up to date.
   If it isn't build the LexGrid project from the lgModel
   directory and copy Castor/lib/lgModel.jar to extLib
2) Make sure that the lbModel.jar is up to date.
   If it isn't build the LexBig project from the lbModel
   directory and copy Castor/lib/lbModel.jar to extLib
3) Remove everything from the current lbInterfaces source directory
4) Open lbModel/EA/, pick the 'org' node and select generate code (see bitmap)
5) from the lbInterfaces directory, run:
	python tools\fixJava.py src
		(This will twiddle all the sources)
6) organize imports for the entire source tree
7) run the ant file.  
8) output is generated to \antBuild directory
