Instructions for building the various parts of the LexGrid master model.
NOTE:  ***** The instructions below are out of date.  Do not use them until revisions have been made!!! ***
Prerequisites:

Enterprise Architect (EA Version 7.1 or later)
Eclipse Ganymede package (Eclipse 3.4). Pick the package that includes the modelling tools.

1) Make the edits in the XML Schema part of the master directory.  Include a list of changes in ChangeLog.txt
2) Create a new EA project in a scratch directory
3) Import all of .xsd's in the master directory into the root package of the new EA Project
      Options: NO Import global elements
               YES Import referenced XML Schema(s)
               NO  Create Diagram for XML Schema(s)
               UML Attribute
4) Export the resulting model to xmi\LexGrid200901_xsd.xmi
			Select root node, Export Package to XMI
			Filename (above)
			Enable full EA Roundtrip
			XMI Type: XMI 2.1
			NO Export ALternate Images
			YES Format XMI Output
			NO Write Log File
			NO Generate Diagram Images
5) Make the corresponding edits to the UML model (We used to synchronize these automatically by going through Hypermodel, but there were just too many issues...)
6) Export the resulting model to xmi\LexGrid200901.xmi 
      Select root node, Export Package to XMI
			Filename (above)
			Enable full EA Roundtrip
			XMI Type: XMI 2.1
			NO Export ALternate Images
			YES Format XMI Output
			NO Write Log File
			NO Generate Diagram Images
7) Compare the two models
		  cd  xmi\tools
		  java -jar saxon8.jar Compare_models.xsl Compare_models.xsl > ..\ModelCompare.html
		  Open ..\ModelCompare.html in a browser and look for disparities.  At the moment, there are a number of flaws in the XML Schema import tool for EA, 
		  so there will be disparities.  Many of these are documented in the heading of Compare_models.xsl.  In particular:
		  	1) The EA XML Schema importer doesn't pay attention to the optional/required property on attributes, meaning that they all have a cardinality of
		  	    [1:1].  These will have to be checked manually
		  	2) EA doesn't get superclasses right
		  Refer to ..\ModelCompare_baseline.html if there are any questions - this is the result of the last proven good comparison.
8) Resolve any issues, repeating the steps above.
9) Once all the differences are resolved, move ModelCompare.html to ModelCompare_baseline.html, to serve as the baseline for the next comparison exercise

10) Transfer all of the documentation from the Schema to the UML model. (NOTE: This is assuming that the documentation "master" is in the XML Schema)
      cd xmi\tools
      java -jar saxon8.jar Transfer_Documentation.xsl Transfer_Documentation.xsl > ..\LexGrid200901_updated.xmi
      Edit the output and check for "ERROR".  As of the last run, there should be exactly one - on editAction in NCIChangeEvent
      	NOTE: Be careful not to pull this file into UltraEdit in r/w mode.  It changes the encoding type, which angers EA
      	
11) Open LexGrid200901.eap in EA. Delete the existing <<SchemaGen>> LexGrid200901 branch.  Then select Import model from XMI...
		YES Import Diagrams
		NO Strip GUID's
		Import LexGrid200901_updated.xmi
		Double check that the diagrams look good and that the documentation appears consistent.



-------------
Generating outputs:
1) Use TortoiseSVN to delete everything except the .svn part of the html/EA directory.  Commit the changes (!)
2) Select the LexGrid200901 part of the model, select "Generate HTML Report".  Preserve white spaces, .png, all other options unselected.
3) Use TortoiseSVN to add and commit all the new model information.
2) Remove everything except the .svn part of the html/oXygen directory.  Open oXygen and select tools/schema documentation... - fill out as follows:

		(oXygen.bmp)
		
------------
Publishing
1) Zip up the XML schema
