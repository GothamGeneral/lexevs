* GForge #8669: Allow concepts defined as synonyms to be left out of root node
  calculation if any synonymous concept is not a root node (participating as
  an intermediate node in the concept hierarchy). 

Updated root node creation to allow concepts defined as
  synonyms to be disregarded if related synonymous concepts
  participates as an intermediate node in the hierarchy.

* Changed the order of the columns in the codingScheme table - moved "firstRelease, modifiedInRelease, deprecated"
  up in front of the two memo columns to get around an Access bug.  Still using version number 1.5

* Created the new 1.5 LexGrid SQL table format.  Updated all SQL code for 1.5 (which supports the 2006 model)
  and added backwards compatibility for older formats.

* Merged in the necessary tables for the NCI history API.
* Got rid of the old NCI history sql utility classes
