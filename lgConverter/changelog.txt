lgConverter Changelog

* 07/14/08
* Complex properties tag handling was adjusted to allow handling of 
* the legacy and new complex properties proposal.  Preferences were also
* adjusted to allow user to select specific property designation over 
* default generic property qualifier designation.  Gforge item #8672.
*
* 07/10/08
* Fixed the OBO loader to add source information for synonyms. Gforge item #14767
*
* 05/10/08 
* Added manifest support to the Protege OWL loader
*
* 05/05/08
* Added support to UMLS loader to provide support for MedDRA classifier
* and association qualifier called SMQ.  Incidentally provides association
* qualifier support for any other UMLS Terminology that should implement
* association qualifiers in this manner.
*
* 02/15/08
* Changes to the UMLS loaders (both UMLS and MetaThesaurus UMLS) to
* load the metadata for Supported Hierarchies. (Gforge #7880)

* 01/22/08
* GForge #10220. Changes to account for circular associations in the 
* Metathesaurus Load. Circular associations are now considered Property 
* Links, not associations.

* 01/21/08
* Changes to NCI Owl loader to insure loading of the new metadata 
* elements contained in the SupportedHierarchy class. 
* Addresses Gforge #7880
* 
* 01/22/08
* Enabled MRHIER relationship processing on the Metathesaurus Loader.

* 01/15/08
* Changes for optimized processing of MRHIER file when loading RRF
* sources.  If processing MRHIER, we only care about entries
* relevant to the specified MRHIER processing option.  Many entries
* in this file we do not require since they can be derived from
* MRREL.  MRHIER typically is much larger since it pre-computes
* the entire hierarchy, so we want to conserve time and space by
* loading only those entries that require special handling.

* 12/14/07
* Added parameter for using Protege database load to NCI OWL loader

* 10/08/07
* Add option for recalculation of root nodes to NCI Meta load.

* 10/2/07
* Updated copyright information for NCI Metathesaurus based on information
* provided by NCI at http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov. 

* 09/26/07
* #3651, NCI OWL loaders should now return an error when a CodeSystem is 
  already loaded prior to doing the conversion.  The structure is implemented 
  for other EMF loaders to do the same, but has not been fully implemented.

* 9/21/07
* Additional changes for hierarchical processing and support to query
* hierarchical relationship by association qualifier (e.g. metathesaurus
* source).

* 9/14/07
* Handle cases where 'PAR' and 'CHD' are not used as the UMLS relation
* name ('REL' field) but 'isa' or 'inverse_isa' are still defined as the
* source relation name ('RELA' field).  As an example MeSH maps 'isa'
* and 'inverse_isa' against relation narrower (RN) and relation broader (RB).
* In addition, RELA names are now interpreted as hierarchical on a
* case-by-case basis (e.g. 'part_of' may be mapped against 'PAR' in one
* source but not another).
*
* Optionally load MRHIER file to intermediate database based on load option
* specified for contextual link processing (improves performance by
* bypassing MRHIER when not referenced).
*
* Misc fixes for UMLS load:
* Fix null pointer exception mapping CUI to code.
* Interpret blank DIR field in MRREL as 'N' instead of 'Y' by default,
* based on review of Meta distribution.

* 9/11/07
* GForge #8669: Reintroduce coding scheme qualification on root node check,
* allowing multiple coding schemes per root code.  Also handle null
* relationsContainerName (match any relations name).  Finally, add support
* to detect and build root nodes and transitivity based on hierarchical
* relations (e.g. PAR, CHD) in addition to hasSubtype during load of
* NCI Meta. 

* 9/10/07
* Add support for loading relations in the text loader.
 
* 9/6/7
* Fixed a few minor issues that made it difficult to load OWL files other
* than the NCI Meta Thesaurus with the NCI OWL loader.

* 9/6/07
* GForge #8669: Updated root node creation for UMLS sources to recognize
* the SRC/RHT assignments in MRCONSO in order to identify the UMLS-assigned
* top node(s) for hierarchical relations.

* 8/17/07
* Corrected OWL manifest code to use namespace/URL of ontology 
* as id in manifest file.
* Corrected NCIOWL loader issue related to ignoring manifest entries. 

* 8/23/07
* Enable case-insensitive check for top node names on NCI2EMF to
* support loading VA-NDFRT through manifest support.

* 8/24/07
* GForge #8669: Accommodate additional subsumption scenarios on import of
* umls relations (i.e. MedDRA root nodes were not built because PAR/CHD
* definition differed from ontologies such as ICD9).  Also allow concepts
* defined as synonyms to be left out of root node calculation if any
* synonymous concept is not a root node (participating as an intermediate
* node in the concept hierarchy).

***********
Release 2.1
***********
* 8/2/07
* Corrected RadLex Loader code to show concept name as entity description as default value.

* 07/27/07
* Change the LexGrid to OBO converter to add Typedef's to the output obo file.

* 05/31/07
* Change date format registered to metadata xml to prevent invalid characters
  from being written in internationalized versions of Windows OS.
* Change NCI Thesaurus formal name to not include underscore, per NCI request.

* 06/12/07
* GForge #7024.  For semantic net load, a single local name is set to the same
  name as the coding scheme to satisfy cardinality described under the LexGrid
  model.

* 6/29/07
* Resolved #7402, issues surrounding the STYPE of properties loaded from CTv3

* 07/17/07 
* Added OWL Manifest support for OWL files.
* Please see more details at NCI GForge Wiki;
* Goto: http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/
* Select link "LexGrid Vocabulary Services for caBIG" Project from project list.
* Select "Wiki" tab. 
* Select "Administrator Tips, Tricks & Gotchas" link.
* Select "Configuring manifest files" link. 

* 07/24/07
* Provide more consistent navigation of subsumptive relations (GForge #7880)
* while preserving general compatibility.  Added automatic build of root
* relation on UMLS load for "UMLS_Relations" container, based on common
* common navigable associations such as CHD (has child) and RB (relation
* broader).  

***********

NCI OWO Conversion
* Coding Scheme name changed to "NCI_Thesaurus" from "NCIThesaurus".
* The order in which entitiy description value for a concept is extracted is changed.
  Now it is first taken from rdfs:label, if not there then taken from display_name,
  if not then taken from browserText or name of concept.
* isNavigable is set to true for hasSubtype association.
* "NCI Thesaurus" and NCI URN "2.16.840.1.113883.3.26.1.1" added as additional local names to the coding scheme.
* Correct URNs are set for Comment, Definition, Textual Representation, Instruction properties.
* Correct URN set for hasSubtype relation.
* "NCI_Thesaurus" has been added as supported coding scheme.
* "some" and "all" are added as supported association qualifiers.
* Changed Protege OWL API call which was performance bottleneck. Conversion is taking
  only 3% of the previous time. (Earlier it taking somewhere between 4 to 8 Hours, Now
  it is taking somewhere between 9 Minutes to 15 minutes).
* Added NCI_NAME Property for each rdfs:ID value.
* top thing "@" node has all valid and correct number of children.
* Relations Names appear in supportedAssociations even if they are not used by concepts.

  will have corresponding supportedAssociation entries (with the "_Role", "_role", 
  "_Association" or "_association" removed.
* Added local name of coding scheme to 40010. Resolved problem with duplication of 
  SupportedAssociations.
* NC_NAME changed to CONCEPT_NAME.

  values properly converted into supportedAssociations and SupportedDataTypes and, 
  other minor changes to handle associations, properties, datatypes etc. (Changes
  made according to the Harold's Suggestions).

  types. 
* OLD_XXX type of properties are removed from ignore-list. 
* Source List has been updated to minimize missed source urns.
* If the OWL API fail to read the versionInfo then a workaround (read it directly from 
  the file using plain java method) has been introduced. the versionInfo value will be 
  read from "owl:versionInfo" tag. The tag MUST end with </owl:versionInfo> to be able 
  to get the correct value.  The versionInfo tag value is search within first 2000 
  lines of file. Similar mechanism has been added for Entity Description coming from
  "rdf:comment".
  
UMLS / MetaThesaurus conversion
* Fixed several errors in the way that the relationships were being loaded.

	* Added an untokenized, lower-cased, unstored copy of the propertyValue to the index, to allow queries such
  	  as non-case-sensitive exact match, and non-case-sensitive starts with.


* NCIOWL conversion: 
   -- Removed depricated calls while populating Coding Scheme:Version, Entity Description.
   -- Synonym, Image_Link, and properties starting with "OLD_" are ignored/not processed.
   -- Fixed load of versionInfo, EntityDescription values from Header. Default values are assigned in case
      of error (while reading header either because of owl:imports, or anything else)
   -- Removed duplication of Textual Presentation creation, when FULL_SYN property has identical text
      as Preferred Name and FULL_SYN has representational Form as "PT" (Preferred Term).
   -- Coding Scheme Copyright information (Terms of Use) is read from a text file, copied at
      "edu\mayo\informatics\lexgrid\convert\emfConversions\nciOwl\NCIThesaurusTermsofUse.txt".

				e.g. acronymFor, abbreviationOf, spellingVariantOf)
				
* The XML and SQL EMF converters now support these new schema changes.  The LDAP converters do not yet 
  support them (because our ldap schema itself has not yet been updated)
