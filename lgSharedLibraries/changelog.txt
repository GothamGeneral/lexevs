Change log and licensing log for lgShared Libraries:

* This is not exclusively a change log, it exists to track changes
* in license files, jar updates and also to explain the presence or lack of
* licenses for certain jars, license versions and differences in licences from
* version to version.. (Scott Bauer)

Saxpath/Jaxen:

License included for saxpath-1.5.jar.  Essentially copied from the jaxen license
text. It was recently integrated into the jaxen project and appears to be
covered by that same license as a result.

Jena:

All jars but the antlr and icu4j jars are licensed under the apache license.  Tom
modified the jena and arq licenses to reflect some language stated on the jena
web page.  Antlr has it's own license and icu4j is licensed by IBM.  

Castor:

Just a note on usage here.  Castor-1.0.2 ships with LexB** distros in the
runtime jar and the extLib.  Castor-1.0.5 is used to build lbModel but does not 
ship with either.
