While fatjar is licensed under the GPL, it is used only at build time
and is not redistributed as part of installation materials (source or
binary).  That being the case, it does not restrict licensing of Lex*
products.  It is used as a convenience, but could be replaced by
alternative function in the build script if necessary.
