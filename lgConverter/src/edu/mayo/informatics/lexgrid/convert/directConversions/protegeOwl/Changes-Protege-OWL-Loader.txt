The following changes/enhancements were made to the Protege OWL loader:

1.) Added support for processing of OWL Datatype properties
2.) Added support for processing of OWL individuals
3.) Added support for handling different types of associations/properties: owl:AllDifferent, owl:complementOf, 
owl:differentFrom, owl:disjointWith, owl:incompatibleWith, owl:maxCardinality, owl:minCardinality, and, owl:sameAs.
4.) Added support for better handling of owl:imports - each codingScheme that is imported by the original
codingScheme, is represented in accordance with the 2008 LexGrid model.
5.) Made changes to how anonymous classes were handled: in the previous loader, a "new" LexGrid concept
was created for every anonymous class present in the OWL ontology. In the current loader, a "new"
LexGrid concept is created only when a new anonymous class is encountered while loading the ontology. That
is, if a particular anonymous class has already been processed, the LexGrid concept corresponding
to it is re-used.
6.) Added support for assigning whether a particular association was asserted (isInferred flag is
set to "false) in the original ontology, or inferred (isInferred = true) as a consequence of executing 
a reasoner on the ontology.
7.) Changes made by Pradip: Removed the database backend support for Protege since it has changed
for the latest version of Protege. In future, we need to support the latest Protege for
BioPortal.
